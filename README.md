# Diorama

Diorama is a tool designed to make short narrative experiences where a solo player wanders through a first-person 3D space and interacts with 2D sprites. It is inspired by existing casual creative tools such as [Twine](https://twinery.org), [Flickgame](https://flickgame.org), and most directly [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy).

Diorama is web-based, and is designed to work across desktop computers, smartphones, and VR headsets. There is no distinction between the "editor" and the "player"; you can both create and play Diorama experiences across desktop, mobile, and VR.

Everything in here is a work-in-progress.
